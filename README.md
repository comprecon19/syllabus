# Computation Reconsidered (ATEK/IIMC-590)

Fall 2019 // Integrated Media, Art and Technology // California Institute of the Arts   

Tuesdays, 7 - 8:50pm // C108  
Instructor: Stephanie Smith // scsmith@calarts.edu  
TA: Autumn Rogers // autumnrogers@alum.calarts.edu // Office Hours: Thursday, 11am-12pm, C110

How can computation be reconsidered within the critical contexts of an art practice? Students will be introduced to the aesthetic possibilities of combining art making, computer programming and digital technology. The classes will explore the fundamentals of programming in a variety of IDEs combined with the investigation of physical media, installation and interactive design. The class assignments will lead to a focus on the expressive capabilities of the human body in a sensor-based environment. The core concepts will involve a dialogue between physical action and digital information. A final group project will implement the body, sensors, and microcontrollers using computer programs written in class.

## Mini-Projects

There will be a "mini-project" at the end of each unit. They are due on the last day of the unit. They consist of continuing development of what you've built in class and presenting it to your classmates ("show-and-tell").

## Final Project

A final project will be due at the end of the semester. You will be creating an installation, which will be installed in C108 on the last day of class. Your final project can be an individual or group project.

## Working in Groups

You have the option to work in groups in class, on all assignments, and on the final project. This will be left to each student's discretion.

## Grading

* **Assignment**: Mini-project: Make a "mini-installation" with your sensor. It doesnâ€™t need to be polished, and it doesnâ€™t even have to work 100%, but I do want you to try using the sensor with some thought behind how you want us to interact with it. Working in groups for this assignment is fine.

## Shared Code/Assignments

Google Drive where you can upload your code:  
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1y-udansSIdrseVeW9Taa4FORcO-1KRgn?usp=sharing

If you're comfortable with GitHub, add your code as repositories (contact me for access):
https://github.com/comprecon19/

I'd encourage you to share your code so your classmastes can take a closer look. Sharing and building off existing code is a great way to learn and develop new ideas.
